The analysis examines how shocks to the federal funds rate affected stock market returns, inflation & market sentiment during the 2020 market crash & the subsequent recovery.

Methodology:
-	SVAR model (two months lag, structural constrains based on economic theory)
Variables: Federal Funds Rate, Inflation, MSCI returns, Composite Leading Indicator

Key Findings:
-	Negative correlation between Federal Funds Rate & stock market returns
-	FFR shocks affected inflation within the first month
-	Market sentiment responded with a one-month lag to policy changes
-	
Tools & Implementation:
-	R for time series analysis & SVAR modelling
-	Statistical hypothesis testing
